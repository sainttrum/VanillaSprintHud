# VanillaSprintHud

A simple mod that adds a HUD element showing whether sprint mode is currently toggled. It works best with toggle sprint, but also functions with hold sprint.

## Version 1 (v1) – Features

VanillaSprintHud v1 focuses on providing a simple, lightweight, and customizable HUD element for Minecraft. Features include:

- **HUD Sprint Display:** Shows whether sprint mode is currently toggled. Works with both toggle sprint and hold sprint.
- **Lightweight & Vanilla-Feeling:** Minimalist design that blends with the vanilla Minecraft HUD.
- **Customization Options:**
  - Text label can be modified via resource packs
  - Scaling customization to adjust the size of the HUD text
  - Color scaling to customize text colors
- **Smart Visibility:** Automatically hides when F1 (HUD hidden), F3 (debug screen), or any in-game menu is open.

## Planned Updates / Roadmap

Future versions may include:

- Optional icons instead of text for sprint status
- More advanced color options and animations
- Configurable HUD position on the screen
- Integration with other mods or status effects
- Expanded version compatibility for more Minecraft versions
